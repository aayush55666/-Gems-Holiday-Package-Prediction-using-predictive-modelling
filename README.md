# -Gems-Holiday-Package-Prediction-using-predictive-modelling
This project is based on 2 cases studies : Gems Price Prediction and Holiday Package prediction. In the first case study, concepts of linear regression are tested and it is expected from the learner to predict the price of gems based on multiple variables to help company maximize profits. In the second case, concepts of logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis are tested. One has to predict if the customer will purchase the holiday package to target the relevant customer base.

 Problem 1: Linear Regression

You are hired by a company Gem Stones co ltd, which is a cubic zirconia manufacturer. You are provided with the dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 27,000 cubic zirconia (which is an inexpensive diamond alternative with many of the same qualities as a diamond). The company is earning different profits on different prize slots. You have to help the company in predicting the price for the stone on the bases of the details given in the dataset so it can distinguish between higher profitable stones and lower profitable stones so as to have better profit share. Also, provide them with the best 5 attributes that are most important.
